# WPT-Test-Coverage

Gives a rough test coverage based on `<link rel="help" href="<speclink>"`.
This will currently provide the unique spec links within the tests.
It will recursively look through the folder and subfolders.

*Note:* This works best on spec generated by [bikeshed](https://github.com/tabatkins/bikeshed)

## Output to file

It by default just prints into the console, so you can output it using the normal
CLI commands such as:

    wptcoverage -f .\ > D:\test-coverage.txt

## Install
    npm install -g wptcoverage

## Usage
    wptcoverage -f <file directory> -t <link to TR version of spec>

## How does it determine possible anchors

Specs have numerous anchors & ids within the spec so this gathers ALL ids & name values from within
the `<main>` element in the spec.
